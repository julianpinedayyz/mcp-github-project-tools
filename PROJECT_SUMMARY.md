# Project Summary: MCP GitHub Project Manager

This document summarizes the development progress, key decisions, learnings, and next steps for the MCP GitHub Project Manager project based on our conversation history.

## 1. Project Goal

The primary objective is to create a **Machine-Composable Plugin (MCP)** for Cursor that allows users to interact with GitHub Projects (specifically Project V2) via CLI commands integrated into the AI assistant workflow.

## 2. Technology Stack & Setup

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Runtime:** Node.js (using Bun as the package manager and runner)
*   **CLI Framework:** `commander` for parsing command-line arguments.
*   **Environment Variables:** `dotenv` for managing configuration like API keys (`GITHUB_PAT`) and repository details (`GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
*   **Testing:** `vitest` configured for unit testing.
*   **GitHub API:** Likely using `@octokit/graphql` or similar for interactions (implied, needs confirmation during implementation).

## 3. Implemented Features & Commands

### 3.1. `GetGithubProjectDetails` Command

*   **Purpose:** Fetch and display details about the GitHub Project V2 linked to the repository configured in the environment variables.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   A command `bin/mcp-github get-project-details` was likely created (structure inferred).
    *   Requires `GITHUB_PAT`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO` environment variables.
    *   Interacts with the GitHub GraphQL API to retrieve project details.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Usage and example output documented in `docs/example_get_project_details.md`.
    *   **Correction:** The initial example output contained user-specific data. It was refined to use generic placeholders for better reusability.

## 4. Configuration

### 4.1. Cursor `mcp.json` Configuration

*   **Purpose:** Integrate the MCP script with Cursor.
*   **Location:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (or OS equivalent).
*   **Structure:** Defined a JSON object with keys:
    *   `command`: Absolute path to the executable (`/path/to/.../bin/mcp-github`).
    *   `env`: Object containing required environment variables (`GITHUB_PAT`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
*   **Documentation:** Detailed setup instructions, including parameter explanations, placeholder examples, and security notes (PAT permissions: `repo`, `project`), were added to `docs/cursor_configuration.md`.

## 5. Documentation Created

*   `README.md`: General project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
*   `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Guidelines for developers contributing to the project.
*   `ROADMAP.md`: High-level plan for feature implementation.
*   `docs/example_get_project_details.md`: Specific documentation for the `GetGithubProjectDetails` command output.
*   `docs/cursor_configuration.md`: Detailed guide on setting up the MCP within Cursor.
*   `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` (This file): Ongoing summary of the development process.

## 6. Development Workflow & Standards

*   **Git Commits:** A standardized commit message format was established:
    *   `category: short description` (e.g., `docs: add cursor configuration documentation`)
    *   Optional detailed body using bullet points.
    *   Categories: `docs`, `patch`, `fix`, `refactor`, `feat`, `chore`, `enh`, `a11y`, `i18n`.
    *   Confirmation is required before executing `git commit` commands.
    *   When requested to "generate commit", the response should be a directly runnable command in the chat interface, not wrapped in any code blocks, quotes, or explanatory text.
    *   Example of correct commit generation response in chat:
        git add "file.txt" && git commit -m "feat: add new feature" -m "- Detail 1 - Detail 2"
    *   The command should appear as plain text that can be directly copied and executed.
*   **Coding Patterns & Preferences (User Defined):** Detailed custom instructions were provided covering:
    *   Simplicity, DRY principle, environment considerations.
    *   Consultation required for major technology stack decisions.
    *   Cautious approach to changes and refactoring.
    *   Code organization, file size limits, avoiding script files.
    *   Correct use of mocking (tests only).
    *   UI change preservation.
    *   Careful consideration before implementing Docker.
*   **AI Collaboration Style (User Defined):** Specified preferences for an AI assistant that is Precision-Oriented, Analytical, Strategic, Adaptive, Concise, Proactive, Context-Aware, Systematic, Decisive, Innovative, Efficient, Growth-Focused, Problem-Solving, Detail-Oriented, Rational, Curious, Resilient, Transparent, Creative, and Collaborative.

## 7. Key Learnings & Decisions

*   The importance of clear, user-focused documentation for both command usage and configuration.
*   The need to generalize examples and avoid user-specific data in shared documentation.
*   Establishing development standards (like commit messages and coding patterns) early on improves consistency.
*   Iterative development approach, focusing on one command/feature at a time (`GetGithubProjectDetails` first).

## 8. Mistakes & Corrections

*   The example output for `GetGithubProjectDetails` was initially too specific and tied to the user's actual project data. This was identified and corrected by replacing specific names/IDs with generic placeholders like `<Project Title>`, `<Project ID>`, etc.

## 9. Next Steps (As of Last Conversation)

*   Begin implementation of the **Add Item to Project** feature/command. This will likely involve:
    *   Defining the command structure (e.g., `add-item-to-project`).
    *   Determining required arguments (e.g., item content/ID, project ID/number).
    *   Implementing the GitHub API call (mutation) to add the item.
    *   Adding corresponding documentation and tests.

## 10. Current Status

The foundational structure of the MCP is in place, including basic setup, environment handling, and the first core command (`GetGithubProjectDetails`). Comprehensive documentation for setup and the implemented command exists. Development standards and workflow preferences are defined. The project is ready to proceed with the next feature on the roadmap.
